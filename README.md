LunaVisualiser.py - An audio visualiser built in Python
=======================================================

## DESCRIPTION

LunaVisualiser is an audio visualiser that allows the user to monitor specific frequencies and amplitudes of live audio.

Each of these monitors can then be assigned or passed to generic visualiser modules - to be written at a later date.

My initial inspiration for creating this project was to replicate visualisers I had previously written in Processing, and to see if it was possible to duplicate the effect with a more powerful and varied language such as Python.

## INSTALLATION

LunaVisualiser currently uses the following python libraries:

* python-opengl
* python-pyaudio
* python-numpy
* python-aubio

And you can install all of these in Ubuntu using this handy single line:

<blockquote><p>sudo apt-get install python-opengl python-pyaudio python-numpy python-aubio</p></blockquote>

## USAGE

To start the visualiser, enter the following on the command line:

<blockquote><p>python LunaVisualiser.py</p></blockquote>
